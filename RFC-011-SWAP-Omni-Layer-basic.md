## Description

This RFC describes to execute a [RFC003](./RFC-003-SWAP-basic.md) SWAP where one
of the ledgers is Bitcoin and the associated asset is an Omni Layer token asset.

For the definition of the Bitcoin ledger see
[RFC004](./RFC-004-SWAP-Bitcoin.md).  For the definition of the Omni Layer token
asset see [RFC010](./RFC-010-Omni-Layer.md).

This RFC re-purposes the Hash Time Locked Contract (HTLC) Bitcoin script from
[RFC005](./RFC-005-SWAP-Bitcoin-basic.md) to lock Omni Layer tokens instead of
Bitcoin.

To fulfil the requirements of [RFC003](./RFC-003-SWAP-basic.md) this RFC
defines:

- How to construct Omni layer transactions transferring Omni Layer tokens to a
  HTLC address

- How to deploy, redeem and refund the HTLC during the execution phase of
  [RFC003](./RFC-003-SWAP-basic.md)

## Constructing an Omni Layer Transaction

This sections describes how to build Omni Layer transactions for the purpose of
a [RFC003](./RFC-003-SWAP-basic.md) SWAP.  Note that Omni Layer uses an account
based model layered on top of Bitcoin's UTXO model.  For a further description
of this see [RFC-010](./RFC-010-Omni-Layer.md#ownership).

### Omni Layer data

This RFC uses the
[simple send](https://github.com/OmniLayer/spec#transfer-coins-simple-send) Omni
Layer transaction type, encoded using the Class C format.  Class C transactions
use Bitcoin [`OP_RETURN`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_RETURN) instruction to
store the Omni Layer data on-chain.

The `OP_RETURN` data MAY be constructed manually according to the
[Simple Send Transfer Coins section of the Omni Layer spec](https://github.com/OmniLayer/spec#transfer-coins-simple-send).
For reference, here are links to the parts of the Omnicore implementation that
produce the `OP_RETURN` data:

- [Encode Class C payload](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/4c9abdecf56c78e3533a64e8034f920cb1d43eb4/src/omnicore/encoding.cpp#L83)
- [Omni prefix for Class C](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/4c9abdecf56c78e3533a64e8034f920cb1d43eb4/src/omnicore/omnicore.cpp#L2040)

Alternatively, the implementer MAY decide to rely on an existing Omni Layer
implementation to generate it.  For example, the
[`omni_createpayload_simplesend`](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_createpayload_simplesend)
RPC api call can be used to produce the `OP_RETURN` data given the following:

- `property_id`: the property id of the Omni Layer Asset (e.g. `31` for TetherUS)
- `amount`: the quantity of Omni Layer Assets to transfer (e.g. `20`)

The 16 bytes produced by the call MUST then be prefixed with the 4-byte Omni
Layer header, `6f6d6e69`, and included in the correct `OP_RETURN` output.

### Dust

Bitcoin Core has limitations on minimum amounts owned by a UTXO.  The minimum
value is 546 satoshis for a normal transaction and 294 satoshis for SegWit
transactions.  See [RFC-010](./RFC-010-Omni-Layer.md#dust) for details.

The values above will be referred as `min_sat` from now on.

`OP_RETURN` outputs are not spendable and hence SHOULD not be assigned any
Bitcoin value.  Only spendable outputs MUST have at least `min_sat` Satoshis
assigned.

### HTLC Address

The HTLC address MUST either be:

1. The P2WSH address of the HTLC, as described in
   [RFC-005](./RFC-005-SWAP-Basic-Bitcoin.md#hash-time-lock-contract)

2. or the P2SH of the P2WSH above, as descriped in
   [BIP-0141 Segregated Witness](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki)

(1) is preferred.  However, not all Omni Layer wallets implementation support
bech32 addresses so (2) can be used as a fallback.

The simple send MUST NOT be done to the old-style P2SH address of the HTLC.

This choice has been made to:

- Limit the number of addresses to watch, making implementation less cumbersome.

- Avoid defining the basic HTLC twice (once, in P2SH format, once in P2WSH
  format).

- Follow the common strategy for segwit backward compatibility (nesting in
  P2SH).

### Inputs & Outputs format to spend from the HTLC output

This section describes specific inputs & outputs to construct an Omni Layer
transaction for *redeeming* and *refunding* the HTLC output.

To construct a transaction to spend from the HTLC, the following information is needed:

| Variable           | Description                                                                                                 |
|:---                |:---                                                                                                         |
| `htlc_utxo`        | UTXO locked by the HTLC, created with the deployment transaction                                            |
| `to_address`       | Address to which the Omni Layer token is sent out of the HTLC                                               |
| `change_address`   | Address to which the Bitcoin change will be sent upon redeeming; MUST be different than `to_address`        |
| `change_utxo`      | UTXO locked by `change_address` that owns some Bitcoin asset to pay for the mining fee                      |
| `init_change_sat`  | Amount of Satoshis owned by `change_utxo` before the redeem                                                 |
| `mining_sat`       | The amount of Satoshi to be spent on mining fees                                                            |
| `omni_data`        | The Omni Layer data that transfers the Omni Layer Asset as described in [Omni Layer data](#omni-layer-data) |

 The Bitcoin transaction MUST be constructed with the following inputs, outputs
 and values.  The *assigned Bitcoin value* on the inputs SHOULD be as described.

 | Inputs (assigned Bitcoin value)      | Outputs (assigned Bitcoin value)                     |
 |:---                                  |:---                                                  |
 | 1. `htlc_utxo` (`min_sat`)           | 1. `to_address` (`min_sat`)                          |
 | 2. `change_utxo` (`init_change_sat`) | 2. `change_address` (`init_change_sat - mining_sat`) |
 |                                      | 3. `OP_RETURN omni_data` (`0`)                       |

The implementor MAY include output (2) `change_address` or MAY decide to omit it
and transfer the Bitcoin change to `to_address`.  If output (2) `change_address`
is present then input (2) `change_utxo` MUST be included to ensure the Omni
Layer Assets are sent to output (1) `to_address`.  In any case, it is unlikely
the transaction will have enough fees to be included if `change_utxo` is not
present.

## Execution Phase

The following section describes how both parties should interact with the
Bitcoin blockchain during the
[RFC003 execution phase](./RFC-003-SWAP-basic.md#execution-phase).

### Deployment transaction

At the start of the deployment stage, both parties compile the contract script
as described in
[RFC-005](./RFC-005-SWAP-Basic-Bitcoin.md#hash-time-lock-contract).  We will
call this value `contract_script`.

To deploy the Bitcoin HTLC, the *funder* must confirm a simple send Omni Layer
transaction transferring the Omni Layer tokens to the HTLC address derived from
`contract_script` on the relevant Bitcoin blockchain.

The transaction MUST have the following properties:

- It MUST be a `valid` Omni Layer transaction.

- It MUST be simple send Omni Layer transaction Class C.

- The simple send `amount` MUST be equal to the `quantity` parameter in the Omni
  Layer asset header.

- It MUST have an output with a `scriptPubKey` in the form of:

  - a Pay-To-Witness-Script-Hash (P2WSH) derived from `contract_script` (See
    [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki#specification)
    for how to construct the `scriptPubkey` from the `contract_script`).

  - OR a Pay-To-Witness-Script-Hash nested in Pay-To-Script-Hash (P2WSH(P2SH))
    derived from `contract_script` (See
    [BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#p2wsh-nested-in-bip16-p2sh)
    for how to construct the `scriptPubkey` from the `contract_script`).

To be notified of the deployment event, both parties MAY watch the blockchain
for a transaction with the above properties.  To validate the transaction,
implementations MAY use the
[`omni_gettransaction`](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore/blob/master/src/omnicore/doc/rpc-api.md#omni_gettransaction)
omnicore API call with the transaction id.  This will return a structure like:

```
{
  "txid": "72abc494e877d7e2491ffa6fea3694648aa75e6166e42d6381b04d41ca933fb5",
  "fee": "0.00003046",
  "sendingaddress": "mxuetdW3Yq8KEsvB4L37Z5jmMQMTxZF9Be",
  "referenceaddress": "2N4CHfBpitHNXj9nBcJCFs7BXUaoNVTegBZ",
  "ismine": false,
  "version": 0,
  "type_int": 0,
  "type": "Simple Send",
  "propertyid": 2147483652,
  "divisible": false,
  "amount": "5300",
  "valid": true,
  "blockhash": "6e9976c5d6c2b4be2928972c93564a0fc0ccdabe4ac581378fad65753559d0b0",
  "blocktime": 1556091362,
  "positioninblock": 1,
  "block": 441,
  "confirmations": 6
}
```
From it, implementations MUST validate the following:

- `referenceaddress`: MUST be the HTLC address (e.g. `2N4CHfBpitHNXj9nBcJCFs7BXUaoNVTegBZ`)
- `valid`: MUST be `true`
- `amount`: MUST be negotiated the quantity of asset (e.g. `5300`)

### Redeem transaction

To redeem the HTLC, the redeemer MUST submit a valid Omni Layer transaction
transferring all the omni tokens from the HTLC address to their desired address
using simple send.  The transaction should be constructed according to the
[Constructing an Omni Layer Transaction](#constructing-an-omni-layer-transaction)
section.  To construct the witness data for the P2WSH output, the redeemer MUST
use the procedure described in the
[Redeem section of RFC005](./RFC-005-SWAP-Bitcoin-basic.md#redeem).

To be notified of the redeem event, both parties MAY watch the blockchain for
transactions that spend from the output and check that the witness data is in
the form specified in the
[Redeem section of RFC005](./RFC-005-SWAP-Bitcoin-basic.md#redeem).  Note that
The witness for the `htlc_utxo` input will contain the secret if it is able to
spend from it even if the transaction is not a valid Omni Layer transaction.

### Refund transaction

To refund the HTLC, the funder MUST submit a valid Omni Layer transaction
transferring all the omni tokens from the HTLC address to their desired address
using simple send.  The transaction should be constructed according to the
[Constructing an Omni Layer Transaction](#constructing-an-omni-layer-transaction)
section.  To construct the witness data for the P2WSH output, the funder MUST
use the procedure described in the
[Refund section of RFC005](./RFC-005-SWAP-Bitcoin-basic.md#refund).

To be notified of the refund event, both parties MAY watch the blockchain for a
transactions that spends from the output and check that the witness data is in
form specified in the
[Refund section of RFC005](./RFC-005-SWAP-Bitcoin-basic.md#refund).

## Examples/Test vectors

### RFC003 SWAP REQUEST

The following shows an [RFC003](RFC-003-SWAP-basic.md) SWAP REQUEST where the
`alpha_ledger` is Bitcoin, the `alpha_asset` is 1 Omni Layer Asset TetherUS
(with `...` being used where the value is only relevant for the `beta_ledger`).

``` json
{
  "type": "SWAP",
  "headers": {
    "alpha_ledger": {
      "value": "bitcoin",
      "parameters": { "network": "mainnet" }
    },
    "beta_ledger": {...},
    "alpha_asset": {
      "value": "omni",
      "parameters": {
        "quantity": "100000000",
        "property_id": 31,
      }
    },
    "beta_asset": {...},
    "protocol": {
        "value" : "comit-rfc-003",
        "parameters" : { "hash_function" : "SHA-256" }
    }
  },
  "body": {
    "alpha_ledger_refund_identity": "1925a274ac004373bb5429553bdb55c40e57b124",
    "alpha_expiry": 1552263040,
    "secret_hash" : "1f69c8745f712da03fdd43486ef705fc24f3e34d54cf44d967cf5cd4204c835e",
    "beta_ledger_redeem_identity" : "...",
    "beta_expiry" : ...
  },
}
```

Note, the property id of TetherUS is `31` and TetherUS is divisible;
the secret for the `secret_hash` is `51a488e06e9c69c555b8ad5e2c4629bb3135b96accd1f23451af75e06d3aee9c`.

### RFC003 SWAP RESPONSE

A valid `RESPONSE` to the above `REQUEST` could look like:

``` json
{
  "status" : "OK00",
  "body": {
     "alpha_ledger_redeem_identity": "c021f17be99c6adfbcba5d38ee0d292c0399d2f5",
     "beta_ledger_refund_identity": "..."
  }
}
```

### HTLC

The above `REQUEST` and `RESPONSE` results in the following parameters to the HTLC:

| Parameter       | value                                                              |
|:----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| redeem_identity | `c021f17be99c6adfbcba5d38ee0d292c0399d2f5`                         |
| refund_identity | `1925a274ac004373bb5429553bdb55c40e57b124`                         |
| secret_hash     | `1f69c8745f712da03fdd43486ef705fc24f3e34d54cf44d967cf5cd4204c835e` |
| expiry          | 1552263040                                                         |


Which compiles into the following Bitcoin script bytes:

```
6382012088a8201f69c8745f712da03fdd43486ef705fc24f3e34d54cf44d967cf5cd4204c835e8876a914c021f17be99c6adfbcba5d38ee0d292c0399d2f5670480a7855cb17576a9141925a274ac004373bb5429553bdb55c40e57b1246888ac
```

Which results in the following P2WSH address by network:

| Network   | Address                                                            |
|:----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `regtest` | `bcrt1q4vft3swvhm5zvytlsx0puwsge7pnsj4zmvwp9gcyvwhnuthn90ws9hj4q3` |
| `testnet` | `tb1q4vft3swvhm5zvytlsx0puwsge7pnsj4zmvwp9gcyvwhnuthn90wsgwcn4t`   |
| `mainnet` | `bc1q4vft3swvhm5zvytlsx0puwsge7pnsj4zmvwp9gcyvwhnuthn90wslxwu0y`   |

and the following P2SH(P2WSH) address by network:

| Network   | Address                               |
|:----------|---------------------------------------|
| `regtest` | `2NEzrgyqU2AB6tHZqeCNnkmHKEDRGpGkDfk` |
| `testnet` | `2NEzrgyqU2AB6tHZqeCNnkmHKEDRGpGkDfk` |
| `mainnet` | `3PSedEuSQhfkgVwHy4kv8pJ41sD6wE8Hc5`  |
