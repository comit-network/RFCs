## Description

This RFC describes BAM!: **B**i-directional **A**pplication **M**essaging.  It
is a domain-agnostic and self-descriptive protocol and potentially supports
multiple encodings.

## Motivation & Requirements

In COMIT, nodes need to exchange all kinds of information in a peer-to-peer
manner.  As COMIT is an inherently distributed system, the network will
eventually become heterogeneous, with an array of implementations, varying in
languages and versions.  Given that, we need a transport protocol that fulfils
the following requirements:

- **Different kinds of messages**: The protocol needs to support requests
  (response expected) and one-way transmissions (no response).

- **Self-descriptive messages**: Because of the heterogeneous nature, the
  protocol needs to allow the introduction of new features without breaking
  older versions.  Self-descriptive messages allow backward compatibility
  because older implementations can still parse newer messages and continue even
  if they don't fully understand its content. (Spoiler: There are also ways to
  force backward incompatibility.)

- **Dynamic/Polymorphic messages**: Similar to HTTP, the messages sent to the
  other party don't always take the exact same form although they convey the
  same meaning.  GET requests for example always describe the intent of
  retrieving a resource.  The concrete structure of two GET requests might
  differ though.  Similar to that, we need to send messages between COMIT nodes
  that communicate a certain intent (like initiate an atomic swap) but might
  take different structure (for example, different information needs to be
  exchanged based on the ledger).

- **Peer-to-peer**: In a communication between two nodes, not always the same
  one initiates, e.g.  both nodes need to be able to actively send messages to
  each other.  Contrary to this requirement, HTTP for example demands that the
  client always initiates the connection/communication.  In addition, it should
  be possible for nodes to work *behind* a NAT.  This means, nodes should only
  use *one* physical connection to talk in both directions.

## Evaluation of existing protocols

We looked at several existing application protocols.  In particular, we
evaluated the following:

- HTTP(2)
- WebSockets
- A profile for BEEP (RFC 3080)
- gRPC and protobuf

### HTTP(2)

HTTP by definition is a client-server protocol.  Unfortunately, this almost
rules it out right from the beginning.  With HTTP2 though, the protocol
introduces so-called `Frames` which, among other things, allow the often cited
PUSH-functionality of HTTP2. One way to use HTTP2 would be to modify the
protocol slightly, so that each party could send `Frames` at any time: Means
also the "server" could send request frames to the client and vice versa.

We decided against this approach because we feared it might falsely suggest
compatibility with HTTP2 software, although this compatibility is not given.
Using HTTP (1 or 2) the intended way doesn't work because it only supports
uni-directional communication.

### WebSockets

WebSockets are the Web's solution for bidirectional communication.  Although it
would support the peer-to-peer requirement, WebSockets have a very low
abstraction level, as they don't specify anything about the actual message that
is sent over.  Instead, the websocket spec mostly deals with things that are
related to the Web (what a surprise!) like protection of shared infrastructure
through masking of the actual payload or upgrades of HTTP connection to a web
socket connection.

While WebSockets could have been a solution, they actually don't provide any
benefit over plain sockets for us.  In order to keep the complexity low, we
decided against it.

### A profile for BEEP

BEEP is a fully bidirectional application protocol and looks very much like what
we needed at first sight.  It covers a wide range of requirements and has many
features.  Unfortunately, it never seemed to get traction and thus, library
support is very limited.  For Rust, we would have had to write our own
implementation.

Although BEEP would fulfil all the requirements, there is no implementation for
it.  We could create and implementation but that would be quite a lot of work
because BEEP covers much more than we need.

### gRPC

Whilst gRPC is a popular way of defining messaging between applications, it
doesn't really fit our requirements: It doesn't work in a peer-to-peer context
as it is centered around the idea of Client-Server.  The messages are neither
self-descriptive nor dynamic: In order to parse a message, a party needs to know
the message format upfront.  This is usually achieved through compiling
`protobuf` files into source code.  The messages are also not dynamic as their
structure needs to be known at compile-time.

Given that, we decided against gRPC.

## Introducing **BAM!**

Given the above evaluation, we are left with defining our own protocol that
implements the stated requirements.  It incorporates ideas from several other
protocols and combines them for our usecase.  In particular, it borrows ideas
from the following protocols:

- BEEP
- HTTP2
- Lightning Network

The main concept in this protocol is called a `FRAME`.

### Frames

Frames identify themselves through a `type` and an `id` and carry a `payload`.

#### Type

The `type` defines how the `payload` of a frame is encoded.  Types also define
the certain semantics of a frame, for example, whether an implementation should
wait for a response to this frame or not.

The following types are allowed:

- REQUEST
- RESPONSE
- ERROR

The following types are reserved for future use:

- NOTIFICATION

#### Id

The `id` of a frame allows nodes to associate frames with each other.  Each node
MUST keep track of the `id` it used on its own.  Nodes SHOULD start with the
value `1` for this id.  The id MUST fit into an unsigned 32-bit integer.  This
means the maximum allowed value is `4294967295`.

Ids MUST NOT be reused for subsequent frames.

A node should only assign `id`s to frames that are out-going and self-initiated,
for example `REQUEST` frames.  All frames that act as a reply to another frame
MUST use the `id` of the message they are replying to.  For example, a
`RESPONSE` frame MUST use the `id` of the `REQUEST` frame it refers to.

Ids MAY be skipped but MUST be ascending.

### Frame types

#### Notification

> `NOTIFICATION` is a reserved type and may be specified at a later point.

#### Request / Response

A request is a type of message that implies an answer.  Nodes MUST be prepared
to receive a frame of type `RESPONSE` with the id used in the `REQUEST` frame.
Alternatively to a `RESPONSE` frame, the other party MAY instead send an `ERROR`
frame.

##### Structure

A frame of type `REQUEST` carries the following payload:

- type
- headers
- body

Conversely, a frame of type `RESPONSE` looks like this:

- headers
- body

With the exception of `type`, all of these are optional and MAY be omitted if
they are empty and the underlying encoding allows this without introducing
ambiguity.  For example, the JSON encoding can easily handle that whereas a
binary encoding may have a difficult time omitting certain fields.

###### Type

The field `type` in a request defines the semantics of the given request.
Defining a particular request type usually comes with defining the headers which
are usable within this request.

###### Headers

`Headers` are supposed to be used by an application protocol defined on top of
`BAM`.  Application protocols can be described by defining `REQUEST` types and,
with them, the semantics of certain headers of a `REQUEST`.

In addition, headers also encode compatibility information.  Each header is
available in two variants:

- MUST understand
- MAY ignore

If a node receives a header in the `MUST understand` variant in a `REQUEST` and
it does not understand it, it MUST reject the request with an `ERROR` frame of
type `unknown-mandatory-header`.  Headers encoded as `MAY ignore` are ok to be
not understood.  Nodes may simply ignore them as if they were not there.

To avoid more complexity through additional messages, the spec doesn't define a
concept for acknowledging processing of a `RESPONSE` to the sender.  Thus, there
is no way of signaling to the sender of a `RESPONSE` whether or not it was
properly understood.  Therefore, careful thought should be put into the design
and use of the `MUST understand` variant of a header to make this failure case
as rare as possible.  In particular, nodes SHOULD NOT send a `RESPONSE` that
contains a `MUST understand` header without them having confidence that the
receiving node will understand it.  Usually, this can be derived from the
`REQUEST` that is sent by a node.

###### Body

The structure of the `body` of a REQUEST is entirely up to the application
protocol.  Application protocols MAY include one or more headers indicating how
the body should be parsed (similar to HTTP's `Content-Type` header).

When designing an application protocol, it is common to overcome the question of
whether a specific piece of data should be encoded as a header or be represented
in the body.  The rule of thumb here is that implementations should be able to
parse all headers orthogonally.  Hence, the structure of one header SHOULD NOT
depend on those of other headers.  All data that cannot be represented in that
way SHOULD be put into the `body`.  Implementations can then first parse the set
of headers to determine the expected shape of the `body`, in order to continue
parsing.

#### Error

The `ERROR` frame is used to communicate failures between nodes at the
communication level.  They MUST NOT be used to communicate errors on the
application level.  Instead, `ERROR` frames are used for received `FRAME`s which
cannot be parsed or are invalid.  An `ERROR` frame can only be sent instead of
reply message (e.g. `RESPONSE`).  Its `id` MUST match that of a previously
received frame, like a `REQUEST` frame.

##### Structure

`ERROR` frames carry the following payload:

###### type

A machine-friendly identifier for this type of error.

###### details

An object which further describes this error.  The shape depends on the `type`
of the `ERROR` frame.

##### Possible error types

This RFC introduces the following ERROR frame types.  Future RFCs MAY extend
this list with new error types.

| type | details |
|---|---|
| `unknown-frame-type` | None |
| `malformed-frame` | None |
| `unknown-request-type` | None |
| `unknown-mandatory-header` | [See below](#details-for-unknown-mandatory-header) |

##### Error details

###### Details for `unknown-mandatory-header`

The details object for the `unknown-mandatory-header` error is an object with a
single key `header`.  Its value is the key of the header that was marked as
mandatory by the sender but was not understood by the receiver.

For example:

```json
{
  "header": "payment_method"
}
```

### Headers

A header is a key-value structure.  Its actual structure is to be defined by an
encoding of this protocol.  This section just describes the semantics that need
to be encoded in a header.

A header's key acts as its identifier.  A header's value MUST encode the
following information:

1. A flag to indicate the variant of this header

    Headers appear in two variants: MUST understand and MAY ignore.  This allows
	nodes with different versions of a particular protocol to enforce rejection
	of a message that contains a header that the other node does not understand.
	It also facilitates incremental rollout of features.  At first, a header can
	be declared as `MAY ignore`.  At some point, an implementation might demand
	that another node understands a particular header by only sending the `MUST
	understand` variant.

2. A value: The actual value that is associated with the header

    Every header MUST have a value.  It functions as the *identity* for the
    given header.

3. Parameters

    Parameters are additional data that depend on a header's value.  A parameter
    for a given header value may be optional or mandatory.  Optional parameters
    may be omitted.  If the header value specifies no mandatory parameters, then
    the parameters section may be completely left out and implementations should
    treat this as if the empty set of parameters was sent.

Splitting headers up into `value` and `parameters` was done for the following
reasons:

1. Having a single `value` facilitates comparison of header values: A node can
   determine whether or not they understand a particular header just by looking
   at the `value`.  If they don't understand the `value`, they also cannot
   understand its `parameters`.

2. It is more consistent: By having `value` and `parameters`, the general
   structure of a header is always the same, independent of the actual data.
   This allows for easier implementation in statically-typed languages.

3. Without a dedicated `parameters` field, there could be a clash with a
   parameter named `value`, if they would just be next to the original `value`
   field.

### JSON Encoding

This section defines a text-based encoding of the above concepts.  Later RFCs
might define a binary encoding in order to increase efficiency.

Nodes MUST use UTF-8 for the actual character encoding. (JSON technically
requires that but just to be sure, it is stated here again.)

A protocol needs to somehow encode, where messages start and where they end.  In
the JSON encoding of BAM, this is solved through newlines.  Thus, each message
MUST be on a single line.  All examples in the following sections are
**pretty-printed** over several lines.  This is just for increased readability
of the RFC.  As mentioned, the JSON documents are actually sent over the wire
**without** newlines.

#### Frames

Each frame is encoded as a JSON-object with the following schema:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://comit.network/transport-protocol/frame.json",
  "type": "object",
  "definitions": {},
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "properties": {
    "type": {
      "$id": "/properties/type",
      "type": "string",
      "title": "The frame type",
      "default": "",
      "examples": [
        "REQUEST"
      ]
    },
    "id": {
      "$id": "/properties/id",
      "type": "integer",
      "title": "The frame id",
      "default": 0,
      "examples": [
        0
      ],
      "minimum" : 0,
      "maximum" : 4294967295
    },
    "payload": {
      "$id": "/properties/payload",
      "type": "object"
    }
  }
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "REQUEST",
  "id": 10,
  "payload": {}
}
```

The field `payload` holds the data for all the different frames and looks
different for every type.  Implementations SHOULD deserialize it into a generic
data structure so that they can handle all types of frames.

#### Encoding of the individual frame types

##### Request

For the `REQUEST` frame, the `payload` looks like this:

```json
{
  "type": "...",
  "headers": {},
  "body": {},
}
```

##### Response

The `payload` of a `RESPONSE` frame shares the same encoding as the `REQUEST`
frame.  As noted above, responses don't have a `type`.

```json
{
  "headers": {},
  "body": {},
}
```

#### Header

This section defines how headers are encoded in the JSON-based text encoding.

##### Representation

Let's start off with an example:

```json
"_payment_method" : {
  "value": "credit-card",
  "parameters": {
    "provider": "tenx",
    "number": "0000-0000-0000-0000"
  }
}
```

In the above example:
- `payment_method` is the header-key.
- The underscore in the beginning denotes that this header MAY be ignored if not
understood.  Respectively, if the key does not start with an underscore, the
header is mandatory and MUST be understood by the node.
- `value` is the header-value (see [Headers - Requirement 2](#headers))
- `parameters` encode the parameters of the header.

##### Default values

Implementations MUST NOT fail if they receive a header without a `parameters`
field but rather default to an empty object (which is equivalent to no
parameters).

##### Allowed values

The `value` of a header MAY be any valid JSON-value.  This includes `object`s
and `list`s.

##### Compact representation

Sometimes, headers only carry one particular value.  For example:

```json
"payment_method": {
  "value": "cash"
}
```

In cases like these, where there are no parameters, implementations can choose
to use the compact representation which looks like this:

```json
"payment_method": "cash"
```

Implementations MUST be able to process compact representations.  They MUST
treat them identical to the version with only a `value` field.  In the compact
representation, the `value` of a header MUST NOT be an `object`.  The following
is therefore invalid:

```json
"invalid_header": {
  "some_key": "foobar"
}
```

If a header needs an `object` to express its value, you should resort to the
default representation to make it unambiguous:

```json
"valid_header": {
  "value": {
    "some_key": "foobar"
  }
}
```

#### Naming conventions

- Frame types should use all caps convention.  For example, `REQUEST`.
- Headers should use snake case convention.  For example, `payment_method`.
- `REQUEST` types should use all caps convention as well.  For example: `BUY`.

### Connection errors / failure cases

The following section describes the behaviour in certain failure scenarios.

#### Malformed response

It can happen that a counterparty sends a malformed response or that the
response is not deserializable due to some other cause.  For requests, an
`ERROR` frame with type `malformed-frame` can be sent back to the other party.
However, there are no response messages for responses.  In this case,
implementations should treat this as a *temporary* failure by logging the
incident and ignoring the malformed response.  Implementations should be able to
receive further messages on the connection.

## Registry extensions

### List of frame types

This RFC adds a section "FRAME types" to track the list of available `type`s to
be used for `FRAME`s.  The following types are added to this list:

- REQUEST/RESPONSE
- ERROR

Each of the defined REQUEST `type`s should list the headers that can be used
with this REQUEST.

For the `ERROR` frame, the `type`s listed in the [ERROR frame](#possible-error-types)
section are added as valid types.
