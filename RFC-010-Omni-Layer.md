## Description

This RFC defines how Bitcoin-based Omni Layer Assets are described in Asset type
headers.  Omni Layer refers specifically to the
[Omni Layer Protocol](https://github.com/OmniLayer/spec).

The Asset type header was introduced in [RFC002](./RFC-002-SWAP.md) to describe
assets being exchanged in a COMIT SWAP protocol.

## The Omni Layer Assets

The Omni Layer Protocol defines several _assets_, also commonly referred as
_coins_ or _tokens_ (from now on referred as Omni _asset_).  It also allows the
definition of new assets by the mean of a Bitcoin transaction containing
specific data.

This asset MUST be used on the Bitcoin Ledger, as defined in [RFC-004](./RFC-004-SWAP-Bitcoin.md).
Subsequent RFCs MAY introduce the support of other ledgers for Omni Layer
Assets.

While *Omni* or *OmniCoin* holds a special place among the assets as being
predefined and having special properties in the Omni Layer Protocol, it is not
different than other Omni assets in the context of the COMIT protocol family.

Each Omni asset defines its name.  Omni assets are uniquely identified by a
*property id*.

For a list of pre-defined Omni assets refer to
[Omni Layer Specs](https://github.com/OmniLayer/spec#field-currency-identifier).

### Ownership

In Omni Layer, tokens are not owned by a specific UTXO but by a specific
address.  This can referred as an *account model*.

The *ownership* of Omni Layer tokens is the ability to spend an output that owns
omni layer tokens.

Because of that not all Omni Layer tokens owned by a given public key have to be
spent in one transaction.  The Bitcoin concept of *change address* does not
apply to Omni Layer.

If a transaction spends only part of the Omni Layer tokens available, then the
remainder is still owned by the original address.

Thus, Bitcoin transactions that deal with Omni Layer often *re-use* addresses by
locking the Bitcoin change against the same public key than the input, instead
of using a brand new public key using [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki).

Finally, using simple send, it seems that only the ownership of tokens of the
**first input** are transferred.  The ownership is transferred to the one output
which:
- is not already present in the inputs (in term of public key)
- is not an `OP_RETURN` output

### Dust

The reference implementation of the Bitcoin Core consensus, _bitcoind_
[enforces](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c536dfbcb00fb15963bf5d507b7017c241718bf6/src/policy/policy.cpp#L129)
that spendable UTXO MUST own enough value to be spent.  If the value owned by a
UTXO is less than the minimum fee for a typical transaction then it is what we
commonly call [dust](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/c536dfbcb00fb15963bf5d507b7017c241718bf6/src/policy/policy.cpp#L20).
A transaction that creates such output is considered as *non-standard* by
bitcoind and rejected under normal configuration.

For `bitcoind`, it is currently defined in term of `dustRelayFee` and it is set
by default to `3000 satoshis-per-kilobytes`.  The minimum value is 546 satoshis
for a normal transaction and 294 satoshis for SegWit transactions.

### Header encoding

To describe an Omni asset in an Asset type header specify `omni` as the value
along with the following parameters:

#### `quantity`

The parameter `quantity` describes the asset's amount.  The `quantity` parameter
is mandatory.


As per the Omni Layer Spec, assets are defined as *divisible* or *indivisible*
at creation.  To cater for these two types of assets, the following behaviour is
defined in the Omni Layer protocol field [Number of coins field](https://github.com/OmniLayer/spec#field-number-of-coins):
- If the asset is **indivisible**, then the `quantity` value is the exact number
  of tokens, i.e. `1` represents one token.
- If the asset is **divisible**, then the `quantity` value represents a hundred
  millionth of a token, i.e. `100,000,000` represents one token.

The `quantity` value will be inserted in the appropriate Omni Layer
transactions, hence the same behaviour is adopted.

Its value MUST be a `u64` (note that in JSON encoding a `u64` is encoded as
decimal string like `"100000000"`).

#### `property_id`

The `property_id` parameter specifies which property id and therefore which
specific asset the asset header is referring to.  The `property_id` parameter is
mandatory.

Note that property id is assigned by the Omni Layer Protocol at the creation of
an asset - it is simply the next available property id.

The property id MUST be of an existing asset on the target Bitcoin ledger.

## Registry extension

This RFC extends the registry's [Assets table](./registry.md#assets) with the
`omni` Asset:

| Value        | Description      |
:---           |---               |
| `omni`       | Omni Layer Asset |

And defines its parameters:

| Parameter        | Value Type | Description                                            |
|:-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `quantity`       | `u64`      | The Omni Layer asset amount to be transferred          |
| `property_id`    | number     | The property id of the Omni Layer asset                |

## Examples

The following shows an example [RFC002](./RFC-002-SWAP.md) JSON encoded SWAP
REQUEST with Bitcoin as the `alpha_ledger` and 1 [Omni Layer asset TetherUS](https://www.omniexplorer.info/asset/31)
as the `alpha_asset`.  Fields that are outside of the scope of this RFC are
filled with `...`.  Note: TetherUS is divisible.

``` json
{
  "type": "SWAP",
  "headers": {
    "alpha_ledger": {
      "value": "bitcoin",
      "parameters": { "network": "mainnet" }
    },
    "beta_ledger": {...},
    "alpha_asset": {
      "value": "omni",
      "parameters": {
          "quantity": "100000000",
          "property_id": 31
      }
    },
    "beta_asset": {...},
    "protocol": "...",
  },
  "body": {...},
}

```
